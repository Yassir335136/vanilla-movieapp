# Vanilla PHP Movie Application

Welcome to the **Vanilla PHP Movie Application**! This project was created with the sole purpose of pushing my boundaries and seeing what I could accomplish using just **vanilla PHP**â€”without relying on any frameworks. Itâ€™s a learning exercise as much as it is a demonstration of building a functional web application from scratch.

## Why I Built This

Iâ€™ve always been curious about the raw power of PHP and wanted to explore what could be achieved without the crutches of a modern framework. The goal was to truly understand the fundamentals and gain a deeper appreciation for the work frameworks handle behind the scenes. Through this project, I aimed to:

1. **Write Pagination from Scratch**  
   I wanted to build a robust pagination system entirely on my own, handling the intricacies of navigating through large datasets efficiently.

2. **Automate Movie Data Insertion**  
   Using the **TMDB API**, I developed a system to automatically fetch movie data and insert it into my database. This required designing workflows to interact with the API, process the data, and store it seamlessly.

3. **Implement a Favorites Feature**  
   I wanted to explore how to allow users to **favorite movies**, save those preferences, and manage themâ€”again, all using vanilla PHP.

## Key Features

- **Custom Pagination**  
  Navigate through movies in the database with a completely handcrafted pagination system.

- **TMDB API Integration**  
  Automatically fetch and update the movie database with information from the TMDB API.

- **Favorite Movies**  
  A straightforward way for users to favorite and manage their list of preferred movies.

## Learning Goals

This project wasnâ€™t just about creating something functional but also about learning and experimenting with:

- Designing and implementing database schemas.
- Making HTTP requests and processing JSON responses from APIs.
- Writing clean, reusable code in pure PHP.
- Handling user input and state (like favorites) in a secure and efficient way.
- Debugging and optimizing custom-built solutions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Run composer install.
3. Run the application on a PHP server. For example:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
4. Access the application via your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Final Thoughts

This project isnâ€™t about reinventing the wheel; itâ€™s about understanding how the wheel works. While frameworks provide countless tools and conveniences, thereâ€™s a unique satisfaction in building something from the ground up. I hope this serves as a helpful reference for anyone curious about the raw potential of vanilla PHP.
